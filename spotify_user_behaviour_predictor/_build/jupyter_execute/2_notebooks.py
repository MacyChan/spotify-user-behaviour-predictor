# # About this project

# ## Why did I start this project?
# 
# I believe everyone has some OCD in their daily lives. In my case, I have some Techno-OCD. Every now and then, it drives me crazy when I see my friends have countless unread emails in their inboxes or multiple tabs remain opened on their browsers. Apart from this, I also have a tiny pet peeve on Spotify playlist. As a loyal Spotify customer, I have been maintaining a personal playlist for over 6 years. Form time to time, I would dedicate my time to clean it up by removing old entries and adding new favorites exclusively fromr different playlists (mainly from the one called Today’s Top Hit). Sometimes, I told myself that I should not spend so much time on organizing this personal playlist. Yet I have an unique taste and I hate to hit “Next” every time I am offered with some automatically-generated songs that I do not enjoy. 
# 
# One day, when I was repeating this time consuming playlist process, this idea popped. Why don't I design an algorithm to help me finish this task, so that I have more time to organize my laptop folders?

# ## Difference with Spotify
# 
# You may have asked, Spotify also has song recommendation, is it not good enough for you? Short answer is Yes, it is not good enough. I enjoy Spotify recommended song and the algorithm is doing a good to recommend songs for me. Most of the recommended songs fits my mood and I give a credit for that. However, I have no control on what songs I would like to pick. Given my raw and desperate story about, I want to be recommend only from some designated playlist, which are the go-to playlist that I like and grab songs that I like from that playlist.
