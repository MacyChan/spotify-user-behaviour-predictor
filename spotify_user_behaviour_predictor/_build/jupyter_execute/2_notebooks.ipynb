    "I believe everyone has some OCD in their daily lives. In my case, I have some Techno-OCD. Every now and then, it drives me crazy when I see my friends have countless unread emails in their inboxes or multiple tabs remain opened on their browsers. Apart from this, I also have a tiny pet peeve on Spotify playlist. As a loyal Spotify customer, I have been maintaining a personal playlist for over 6 years. Form time to time, I would dedicate my time to clean it up by removing old entries and adding new favorites exclusively fromr different playlists (mainly from the one called Today’s Top Hit). Sometimes, I told myself that I should not spend so much time on organizing this personal playlist. Yet I have an unique taste and I hate to hit “Next” every time I am offered with some automatically-generated songs that I do not enjoy. \n",
    "\n",
    "One day, when I was repeating this time consuming playlist process, this idea popped. Why don't I design an algorithm to help me finish this task, so that I have more time to organize my laptop folders?"

    "You may have asked, Spotify also has song recommendation, is it not good enough for you? Short answer is Yes, it is not good enough. I enjoy Spotify recommended song and the algorithm is doing a good to recommend songs for me. Most of the recommended songs fits my mood and I give a credit for that. However, I have no control on what songs I would like to pick. Given my raw and desperate story about, I want to be recommend only from some designated playlist, which are the go-to playlist that I like and grab songs that I like from that playlist."
