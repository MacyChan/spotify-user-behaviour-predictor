I’ll be right there with a smile on my face”. Nothing more ever evolved out of the Fight Klub challenge,though it is rumored that Em wasn't up for the challenge when Mic Club called Shady back and challenged Em to an actual battle. Either way,NA
among other things:,NA,NA
you had all this time to think about it now / don’t pussy out and try to about face me / Cause I’ve been ‘patiently waiting’ for the day / We finally meet in the same place to see…”. The logic is this: he's basically saying that Bis has had time to come up with content for the battle bein' that he was overseas and that Em has been waiting for him to come back. Now that Bis has been back a bit he seems to want to squash and move on. As I said before,Bis said he had heard rumors that Em was gonna come out and face him. I think Em is addressing the issue about Bis not accepting the challenge. Plus,NA
"I ran 8 Miles / I ain’t the same old nigga with the same style”. Most of the material from that bootleg recorded for """"Hip-Hop for Sale""""","including that """"Dear Academy"""" track",NA
"he says something to the effect """"I'll take you on mano e mano""""",showing that Bis was ready for this beef to be taken to the next level. Here are the lines about Em:,NA
"the song where Em attempted to squash beef with Ja Rule and Benzino: """"Wake up",smell the roses,NA
I don't want to waste no lyrics talkin' about you / just let my body die and rot in hell why don't you / You asked the same question,I already told you / I'm a lyricist,NA
you can’t,cause when you get RIGHT down to it,NA

for it is never slow in taking bodily form and proliferates upon a face,especially on the cheeks and round the eyes,NA
upon my word,Brichot,NA
did we not know that such replies are determined,unknown to the person who utters them,NA
and of whom she said: “He keeps writing me letters begging me to be careful! What do you say to that,my little white puss,NA

never ventured into the street,always expecting to find a policeman at her heels. “She can do whatever she likes! It would be a waste of time and money to follow her! As if her goings on mattered to us!” the old servant ironically exclaimed,NA
that is always the stumbling block,to find something decent to set to music. One might even consider a libretto. It would not be without interest,NA
that Bergotte felt for him,to be able to do a great service to Morel,NA

I could not help recalling how I had thought of the other worlds which Vinteuil might have created as of so many universes as hermetically sealed as each of my own love-affairs,whereas in reality I was obliged to admit that in the volume of my latest love — that is to say,NA
that ineffable something which makes a difference in quality between what each of us has felt and what he is obliged to leave behind at the threshold of the phrases in which he can communicate with his fellows only by limiting himself to external points common to us all and of no interest,art,NA

must refer motions systems coordinates relative fixed stars move circle system coordinates state motion law inertia holds relative called galileian system coordinates laws mechanics galileinewton can regarded valid galileian system coordinates v principle relativity restricted sense order attain greatest possible clearness let us return example railway carriage supposed travelling uniformly call motion uniform translation uniform constant velocity direction translation although carriage changes position relative embankment yet rotate let us imagine raven flying air manner motion observed embankment uniform straight line observe flying raven moving railway carriage find motion raven one different velocity direction still uniform straight line expressed abstract manner may say mass m moving uniformly straight line respect coordinate system k will also moving uniformly straight line relative second coordinate system k provided latter executing uniform translatory motion respect k accordance discussion contained preceding section follows k galileian coordinate system every coordinate system k galileian one relation k condition uniform motion translation relative k mechanical laws galileinewton hold good exactly respect k advance step farther generalisation express tenet thus relative k k uniformly moving coordinate system devoid rotation natural phenomena run course respect k according exactly general laws respect k statement called principle relativity restricted sense long one convinced natural phenomena capable representation help classical mechanics need doubt validity principle relativity view recent development electrodynamics optics became evident classical mechanics affords insufficient foundation physical description natural phenomena juncture question validity principle relativity became ripe discussion appear impossible answer question might negative nevertheless two general facts outset speak much favour validity principle relativity even though classical mechanics supply us sufficiently broad basis theoretical presentation physical phenomena still must grant considerable measure truth since supplies us actual motions heavenly bodies delicacy detail little short wonderful principle relativity must therefore apply great accuracy domain mechanics principle broad generality hold exactness one domain phenomena yet invalid another priori probable now proceed second argument moreover shall return later principle relativity restricted sense hold galileian coordinate systems k k k etc moving uniformly relative will equivalent description natural phenomena case constrained believe natural laws capable formulated particularly simple manner course condition amongst possible galileian coordinate systems chosen one k particular state motion body reference justified merits description natural phenomena calling system absolutely rest galileian systems k motion instance embankment system k railway carriage system k

necessarily play part expect instance note emitted organpipe placed axis parallel direction travel different emitted axis pipe placed perpendicular direction now virtue motion orbit round sun earth comparable railway carriage travelling velocity kilometres per second principle relativity valid therefore expect direction motion earth moment enter laws nature also physical systems behaviour dependent orientation space respect earth owing alteration direction velocity rotation earth course year earth rest relative hypothetical system k throughout whole year however careful observations never revealed anisotropic properties terrestrial physical space ie physical nonequivalence different directions powerful argument favour principle relativity vi theorem addition velocities employed classical mechanics let us suppose old friend railway carriage travelling along rails constant velocity v man traverses length carriage direction travel velocity w quickly words velocity w man advance relative embankment process possible answer seems result following consideration man stand still second advance relative embankment distance v equal numerically velocity carriage consequence walking however traverses additional distance w relative carriage hence also relative embankment second distance w numerically equal velocity walking thus total covers distance w v w relative embankment second considered shall see later result expresses theorem addition velocities employed classical mechanics maintained words law just written hold reality time however shall assume correctness vii apparent incompatibility law propagation light principle relativity hardly simpler law physics according light propagated empty space every child school knows believes knows propagation takes place straight lines velocity c kmsec events know great exactness velocity colours case minimum emission observed simultaneously different colours eclipse fixed star dark neighbour means similar considerations based observations double stars dutch astronomer de sitter also able show velocity propagation light depend velocity motion body emitting light assumption velocity propagation dependent direction space improbable short let us assume simple law constancy velocity light c vacuum justifiably believed child school imagine simple law plunged conscientiously thoughtful physicist greatest intellectual difficulties let us consider difficulties arise course must refer process propagation light indeed every process rigid referencebody coordinate system system let us choose embankment shall imagine air removed ray light sent along embankment see tip ray will transmitted velocity c relative embankment now let us suppose railway carriage travelling along railway lines velocity v direction ray light velocity course much less let us inquire velocity propagation ray light relative carriage obvious can apply consideration previous section since ray light plays part man walking along relatively carriage velocity w man relative embankment replaced velocity light relative embankment w required velocity light respect carriage w c v velocity propagation ray light relative carriage thus comes smaller c result comes conflict principle relativity set forth section v like every general law nature law transmission light vacuo must according principle relativity railway carriage referencebody rails body reference consideration appear impossible every ray light propagated relative embankment velocity c reason appear another law propagation light must necessarily hold

whilst the Eunuch walked by his side and told him nothing,but said to him,NA

This is the most perilous thing I ever did; now what be the most perilous thing thou hast ever done?' He rejoined,NA

"O Princess of wits and recourse of Kings and Cohens warring for their blood wit!"""" So when the army of Al-Islam came upon them in chat valley",before they knew of it the flames began to burn up the tents and the swords in men's bodies to make rents.

for his face was as the face of an ass,his shape that of an ape and his look as the look of a malignant snake: his presence was grievouser than parting from the beloved make; and blacker than night was his blackness and more fetid than the lion was his breath for foulness; more crooked than a bow was his crookedness and grimmer than the leopard was his ugliness,NA
and sped at him a second throw spear which smote him and the point fell on his forehead,in the very centre of the sign of the Cross,NA

but Allah assigned victory to the Faithful and defeat to the Faithless. The Wazir Dandan shouted,"""""Take your blood revenge for King Omar bin al Nu'uman and his son Sharrkan!""""; and bared his head and cried out to the Turks. Now there were by his side more than twenty thousand horse",NA
"""""By the truth of the Messiah",there remaineth no profit of my life,NA

which might at the same time prove shocking to our ideas,just as her way of listening to our assertions bore witness to her incredulity,NA
almost separated from the rest,in a prominence that was a form of speech,NA
had come towards me,with the sole result that I had been able to see that she had nothing in real life of that amorous facility which one supposed to be stamped upon her in the magic pictures. I had learned that it was not possible to touch her,NA
and,since the cycles through which we are able to make things and people pass in the course of our existence are comparatively few,NA
give successively as setting to the same church the arched walls of all the others — I can think of nothing that can so effectively as a kiss evoke from what we believe to be a thing with one definite aspect,the hundred other things which it may equally well be since each is related to a view of it no less legitimate. In short,NA
well,you see,NA
a sort of conventional and unexpected devotion; and it was farther than to her own childhood,it was to the infancy of the race that she had reverted. Very different from myself who had looked for nothing more than a physical alleviation,NA
I admire her style.” Our mothers were acquainted only in the imagination of Mme. Bontemps,who having heard that I had at one time played with Robert Forestier,NA
we forestall the mistake by a grimace of disgust when anyone refers to them in our hearing. When we read our own name,as borne by them,NA
laying her hands on my forehead (as was her habit when she was afraid of hurting my feelings) and saying: “You really must stop hanging about trying to meet Mme. de Guermantes. All the neighbours are talking about you. Besides,look how ill your grandmother is,NA
was endeavouring to conceal her sufferings from the eyes of the neighbours. Quite half of the human race was in tears. And when I came to know the people who composed it I saw that they were so exasperating that I asked myself whether it might not be the adulterous husband and wife (who were so simply because their lawful happiness had been withheld from them,and shewed themselves charming and faithful to everyone but their respective wife and husband) who were in the right. Presently I ceased to have even the excuse of being useful to Jupien for continuing my morning wanderings. For we learned that the cabinet-maker in our courtyard,NA
make gestures indicative of a complete surrender. She resumed an icy coldness towards me if anyone appeared whom she knew. For a long time now in these morning walks,thinking only of what I had to do,NA
the quarantine of the outsider,hopelessly uncouth,NA
having made up her mind to invite me,she was anxious to do me the honours of the best company at her disposal and to keep away those of her friends whose presence might have dissuaded me from coming again,NA
to some page,already filled and turned,NA
did he make it drop in a series of little jerks broken by pauses for at least ten minutes?” or of a Labori: “Why,whenever he opened his mouth,NA
or at least from her manner,that on studying her face whenever she had occasion to treat with the most exquisite simplification what in so many other people would have been a pretext for reviving stale antipathies and recriminations one had the impression of an intense purity of mind,NA
like his father in the Case of Bergotte,knew the Baron ‘without actually knowing him,NA
it is true that,generally speaking,NA
one follows along the brink of the shivering water those attractive paths by which already a first red leaf is blooming like a last rose,one scans that horizon where,NA
and the swift smile of a child whom one did not suppose to be awake. Then one would like to have with one a loving companion,all the more as one feels oneself to be alone and can imagine oneself to be far away from the world,NA
far more thickly than in the streets of the town,it must after sunset be invading the Bois,NA
to her eyebrows,seemed to hesitate. She had probably other plans; if so she sacrificed them willingly,NA
for a purely voluptuous hour,as I held in my arms a body of which my curiosity had long since computed,NA
alone in a great wood which seemed to be consecrated to her,filled it with the mythological terror,NA
delicious emptiness of which I had learned at Balbec to know and to enjoy when,alone in my room as I was now,NA
voluptuous,whimpering passages which sound over the chant of the pilgrims towards the end of Overture to Tannhäuser. I had,NA
have been directed elsewhere,to Mme. de Stermaria; its application to her who inspired it in me so soon afterwards was not therefore — as I so longed so needed to believe — absolutely necessary and predestined,NA
penetrating,icy rain,NA
or that there could be any kind of significance in the fact of one’s leaving one’s work to go and see a friend and shed tears with him on hearing the false report that the Louvre was burned. I had got so far,at Balbec,NA
who,having to start next day for the country,NA
like that of a Christmas manger,just visibly starred here and there by a wick that burned no brighter than a candle. Between that year — to which I could ascribe no precise date — of my Combray life and the evenings at Rivebelle which had,NA
from which he at once expelled me,indicating to me,NA
and the buzz of talk which restored their activity to deafened ears,NA,NA
to titter with sneering contempt or fling back one’s head with a look of fury,to pretend not to know some elderly man who might have done them a service,NA
and not having enough self-control to stifle a spontaneous cry of stupefaction and rage. “So you like the idea of marriage,do you Bibi?” the Prince de Châtellerault could not help exclaiming,NA
to prevent a marriage or to secure a hold over the friend whose secret he discovered. A fifth (for in these groups of four there are never four only) had joined this Platonic party who was more so than any of the others. But religious scruples restrained him until long after the group had broken up,and he himself was a married man,NA
you can’t find it again.” The wisdom of this aphorism impressed the proprietor,for he had already heard it several times in the course of the evening,NA
if they have not been wrong to abandon the practice of attributing the actions of peoples to the will of kings,ought to substitute for the latter the psychology of the person of no importance,NA
a familiarity from which I alone was excluded,not unlike the spirit that must have prevailed in Noah’s ark. Suddenly I saw the landlord’s body whipped into a series of bows,NA
one realised afterwards that if they had against them hair worn too long,noses and eyes that were too big,NA
but was prevented by the arrival of M. de Foix. Come to see whether his request had been favourably received,we caught sight of him standing beside our table. Robert introduced us,NA
had its meaning,its cause in Saint-Loup’s own personal nature,NA
led him to trample them underfoot,just as he had,NA
included glimpses of historic grandeur of which I became conscious when I went to dine in his house,on the evening following that which I had spent with Saint-Loup,NA
when the Guermantes had ceased to impress me and the tiny drop of their originality was no longer vaporised by my imagination,I was able to distil and analyse it,NA
shews the trace of some historic event unknown,it may be,NA
if not actually forgotten,at the time of Herodotus,NA
before coming gradually down to us,have been enacted by many other Guermantes for numberless other visitors. And as I had said to the Duke that I would like very much to be left alone for a few minutes with the pictures,NA
which has given us the mirage of depth. In view of which is it not logical,not by any artifice of symbolism but by a sincere return to the very root of the impression,NA
they had supposed,must remain for ever a ‘horror’ (Manet’sOlympia,NA
the innumerable reflexions of one thing and another came crowding into this little square panel of beauty which Elstir had cut out of a marvellous afternoon. What delighted one in the dress of a woman who had stopped for a moment in the dance because it was hot and she was out of breath was irresistible also in the same way in the canvas of a motionless sail,in the water of the little harbour,NA
this politeness would be more complete if,by not having dinner announced immediately,NA
so that the smile which she was holding on indefinitely,like the note of a tuning-fork,NA
without my having to stir from Paris,of myself; it was in the algebraical expression of a journey to the city of Correggio a simple equation,NA
by weakening your own position,would diminish the efficacy of your benevolent activities.”,NA
it was important that the great should keep up the exalted traditions of lordly hospitality,by speeches which involved them in nothing. It was also because she sought,NA
M. de Guermantes,with a gallantry that would have done credit to Marshal Saxe,NA
whose own tastes,in later life,NA
entertaining the Duc de Chevreuse at dinner,pretends,NA
habitually dissembled by her mother and intolerable in the sight of her Creator,it was,NA
to think: ‘These people are of another race than ours,and we are,NA
and were in politics so socialistic that one asked oneself where in her mansion could be hiding the familiar spirit whose duty it was to ensure the maintenance of the aristocratic standard of living,and which,NA
whenever she had a message to give to her husband she would say to the butler: “Remind Monsieur le Duc —”,NA,NA
a sort of undefinable convulsion (like that of the Serpent,the genius of the Carthaginian family of Barca) by which my heart had more than once been set throbbing,NA
little enough had it been a question of a passage of arms,seemed immense for a handclasp,NA
for that matter,very rarely occurred — was presented to anyone of the Saint-Loup subsection racked his brains over this abrupt minimum of a greeting,NA
who had scarcely a penny to her name,created more stir with her clothes than all the Courvoisiers put together. The really scandalous things she said gave a sort of advertisement to her style of dressing and doing her hair. She had had the audacity to say to the Russian Grand Duke: “Well,NA
de Montpensier,and she is the eighteenth Oriane de Guermantes in succession,NA
” she imagined herself to have no other reason for consenting to receive them than this charm or cleverness,the familiar spirit not interposing itself at this last moment; more deeply rooted,NA
that Oriane does not care for women’s conversation. She lives surrounded by a court of superior minds — I am not her husband,I am only the first footman. Except for quite a small number,NA
meanwhile,her mind fixed on her game or conversation,NA
they would not be asked to her house. These were a special set of parties,a privilege barred to so many who must have longed for admission. The excluded could,NA
at his own house he entertained no one outside the Faculty,at banquets over which there floated an aroma of carbolic. But in powerful corporations,NA
’ who had never stood for the Chamber,felt,NA
one as a pedant and the other as a clown,despite all the learning of one and the other’s genius,NA
”) might indeed be del void of wit according to Mme. de Guermantes (and in this respect she was right); yet,by dint of hearing and repeating her sayings they had come to imitate more or less her way of expressing herself,NA
but especially about my brother,who is very susceptible,NA
not in reproach but letting her understand all that her clumsiness had made her miss. It was her fault alone if she had not been present at the Creation of the World or at Mme. Carvalho’s last performance. “What do you think of Oriane’s latest? I must say,I do enjoy ‘Teaser Augustus’,NA
who in her own house entertained the flower of the Faubourg Saint-Germain,was quite surprised when she found at Mme. de Courvoisier’s only a notorious old sponger whose husband had been an Imperial Prefect,NA
if from her girlhood everyone had been pitying a model wife,a true saint,NA
Prince des Laumes,sat in the Chamber,NA
that when they open the Deputies themselves are like the commonsense person who will read the published report. Learning that certain workers on strike have sent their delegates to confer with a Minister,they may ask one another innocently: “There now,NA
that is to say the opinion which ought to have been foreseen namely that a duchess ‘was not expected’ to attend the fancy dress bali given by this new Minister: “I do not see that there is any necessity to go to the Greek Minister’s; I do not know him; I am not a Greek; why should I go to these people’s house,I have nothing to do with them?” said the Duchess. “But everybody will be there,NA
sometimes auburn,like the most recent,NA
all the women who had responded to M. de Guermantes’s love,and sometimes even when they had not yet surrendered themselves to him,NA
became a nuisance. The Duke began to take a dislike to her. Then Mme. de Guermantes had an opportunity to bring into prominence the real or imagined defects of a person who annoyed her. Known as a kind woman,Mme. de Guermantes received the telephone messages,NA
casting to right and left of him a glance of amusement,“you heard the Princess tell you that she was a superior woman.” “But isn’t she?” “Superior in chest measurement,NA
to win admiration for the Duchess. “Now,then,NA
” the Duchess interrupted him,“if you mean to inform me that I knew M. de Bornier,NA
perhaps,but in the evenings,NA
upon tragic and other kinds of poetry,a series of remarks which did not reach me distinctly until I caught the following from Mme. d’Arpajon: “Oh,NA
” said the Princesse de Parme to her hostess,impressed by the ardent tone in which the speech had been delivered. “No; she knows absolutely nothing about it,NA
and the usage of nobles who fraternise more readily with their peasants than with the middle classes; peculiarities all of which the regal position of Mme. de Guermantes enabled her to display more easily to bring out with every sail spread. It appears that the same voice existed also in certain of her sisters whom she detested,and who,NA
a thorough relaxation to listen to the talk of Mme. de Guermantes — almost the same feeling,if one was alone with her and she restrained and clarified still further her flow of words,NA
her Pailleronism,her taste for the younger Dumas were reflected and deliberate. As this taste was the opposite of my own,NA
because he no longer loves her; not in the least,it was because he won’t put her sons down for the Jockey. Does Ma’am call that the behaviour of a woman in love? No; I will go farther;” Mme. de Guermantes added with precision,NA
unconscious or deliberate,which accompany one’s name on the label which society writes out and attaches to one. I remember that a friend of the Guermantes who had expressed a keen desire to meet me gave me as the reason that I was a great friend of his cousin,NA
but Robert flung it out without pausing for breath,one could hardly make out that there was Latin in it,NA
“but he thinks he’s obliged to look severe because you are present,Ma’am,NA
yes,if I see him — it is possible that I may meet him,NA
’ as Mme. Swann would have said,without being expected,NA
as they do with Sovereigns,by proxy,NA
where the wife has had the good taste to stop at the golden,the husband the misfortune to come down to the pinchbeck age of history,NA
when the Princess,unfortunately,NA
whose views of wisdom were somewhat superficial,“and the two branches haven’t intermarried since Louis XIV’s time; the connexion would be rather distant.”,NA
by the accumulation of all the women who had successively borne it,but also in the course of my own short life,NA
but they had known,long before they knew all these names,NA
you have only to talk to his servants,and they,NA
very often these ‘cousins’ were not even related at all. Then from the lips of M. de Guermantes,would flow a fresh wave of “But she’s Oriane’s cousin!” words which seemed to have for the Duke the same practical value as certain epithets,NA
empty-handed,of the ambassadors who had been sent to sue on her behalf for the hand of the Prince of Syracuse,NA
who knew the impossibility of my dear M. de Nassau’s writing to the grandfather of his wife (whose fortune,moreover,NA
the name — which I had found colourless and might have supposed to be modern — of Norpois,carving deeply upon it the beauty of an old medal. And in these cases,NA
with which I had never suspected it of having any affinity,left the unalterable position which it had occupied in my brain,NA
the mysterious life of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. But this departure which I was trying at every moment to effect,M. and Mme. de Guermantes carried the spirit of self-sacrifice so far as to postpone,NA
and to speak to me — a veiled allusion to an invitation to dinner — of her desire to ‘arrange something’ after she had ‘fixed a day’ with Mme. de Guermantes. None of these flower ladies left the room before the Princesse de Parme. The presence of that lady — one must never depart before Royalty — was one of the two reasons,neither of which I had guessed,NA
sought an outlet in a sort of fugitive effusion,all the more intense,NA
your Royal Highness can be reassured,” broke in the lady in waiting with a knowing air,NA
whence the gloomy faces of so many men of fashion,and all those nervous conditions which may make them end in suicide. Well,NA
append to their signatures a philosophico-poetical reflexion,he used to warn novices in an appealing tone: “Your name,NA
with the conditions of a life almost unknown today. In the death-chamber of a contemporary corpse Mme. de Guermantes would not have pointed out,but would immediately have perceived,NA
and it was in long monologues with myself,in which I rehearsed everything that I was going to tell him and gave scarcely a thought to what he might have to say to me,NA
and followed the Baron,who,NA
you were waiting in this room. No? Ah,then they must have put you in the blue drawing-room,NA
the bait of this offer,he held out his hand,NA
my dear friends,if I arrived suddenly like that at full speed at Les Ecorces. But on that head I shall no more keep silence for I feel that the frenzy of grief sweeps its reason away. I am associating with the Duchesse de Guermantes,NA
any more difficult than to dine with the Duchess,and my slight knowledge of heraldry had taught me that the title of Prince is not superior to that of Duke. Besides,NA
but which,once they have been digested by the reindeer,NA
to Prince Friedrich-Karl. We are bored at a dinner-table because our imagination is absent,and because it is bearing us company we are interested in a book. But the people in question are the same. We should like to have known Mme. de Pompadour,NA
far more intelligent,they don’t think of nothing,NA
we thought it prudent,each of us independently,NA
with their tall,wide chimneys to which the sun imparts the most vivid pinks,NA
is not ready. There’s no use saying anything before Swann about Marie-Gilbert’s party,” said the Duke. “I don’t know whether he’s been invited. Gilbert likes him immensely,NA
do you think it’s by one of those big masters I’ve mentioned?” “Nnnnno,” said Swann. “But after all,NA
to be a man of iron,like Comely. “No,NA
making with his lips the grimace which implies: ‘The devil!’ Mme. de Guermantes rippled with laughter. “So my clothes please you? I’m delighted. But I must say that they don’t please me much,” she went on with a sulking air. “Good Lord,NA
who was,incidentally,NA
” said the Duchess to a footman. “Please,Oriane,NA

Gas Pedal (feat. IamSu),Sage The Gemini,okay I looking rap song charts last week trying figure review gotta say I kinda happy top holy grails bad song number one next three slots taken three macklemores singles love number two awesome now song rounds top five list song called gas pedal sage gemini featuring iam su guys short list people thought good idea rap name short sentence right souljaboy tellem shows pic souljaboy well tell em real sage gemeni song high charts can name recognition know anyone heard fact havent even heard song hey high guy must real explosive single hands lemme check real quick minutes later well terrible let us make fun video intro ever get feeling rappers taking way serious beat starts yeah cheesy note beat totally worthy ominous intro hhhholy shit guarantee nothing song warrants much enthusiasm slow grab wall wiggle like tryna make yo ass fall hella thick wanna smash now speed gas pedal speed gas pedal now speed gas pedal remember said nothing song warrants much enthusiasm yeah apparently sage believes really still drain energy voice order sound cool thing difference sounding like really cool calm charge sounding like just really bored mean dude even wanna right now need party songs sounding like mandatory activity trying get soon possible least tech n ne puts serious voice still lets know whatever liken bout bubble smokin drinkin humpin likin chorus just get feeling like trying sound mature unaffected idea fun sends wrong vibe one person want hang party douche bag wants act like good show emotion beyond maybe act like care anything can trick girls thinking I interesting pick energy verses though spiritless tone music already taken precedent black money let hoes say amen I just tryna make clear boy raybans sunglasses improve eye sight actually make things dimmer suppose talking branch company makes eyeglasses usually people think say raybans also tried rhyme amen raybans points I great man really trying convince sage gemeni dungeons dragons rap name play hole every night dj amen huh figured golf pun order play words I sage like know nobody months feefi fofum large yo throat laugh ugh westside baby got tail shit funny first line just sounds like setup line know like someone thinks cool punchline can find clever way set lyric just insert throwaway line rhymes funnier following punchline except like somehow forgot punchline just said another filler line place great now two lines interesting mad cause spoon give fork silverware nigga actin poor spork give line credit rhyme fork spork used poor spork crappy play words poor sport initially tried justify wordplay awkwardly starting outofplace lyric brags dudes mad spoons mean spooning mean something else guys far can tell bragging guys jealous cuddling abilities also gotta ask real quick anyone see problem girls music video namely uh shows girls stiff statues look I asking show hardcore twerking anything goodness sakes music video song girls shaking asses least make look like somebody might want dance mean show girls dark lighting posing like mannequins can help feel sends even worse message like girls allowed enough autonomy least look good time can sexy expressionless trophies collection say want music video girls bikinis backyard pools least fits mood trying way hard dark music video song girls butts lighten seriously can barely make happening video well enough sages verse now time boy named su spit verse trick dolla bill boyfriend bitch call tyler perry eugh wow even sound disappointed line like eugh even try rhyme I black bat lookin scary way cake bakeary oops bakeries oh god hate rappers acknowledging said word almost rhymed line instead erasing starting mispronounce acknowledge laziness cute little oops meant say teehee continue rhyme remember method man used sometimes method man protect ya neck sub crazy oh yeah guy sometimes lil wayne got nothin barry bonds run town mr carter mean bakery never fakary lead bathroom askin takin uh tell slow baby I turned bout go baby wait telling slow one trying figure going well love response question basically sorry I turned sex disgusting club bathroom possible option hit stage people still talking chick cause given us reason think still talking chick sounds like calling ugly reason niggas fugazi got white bitch call ho slim shady first name happen stan real man refers attractive woman dude way shape form furthermore slim shady honestly famous white celebrities think think skipping lot details go peoples heads hear someone make comparison two things say girl reminds eminem first thing think crazy chick bashes gay people fantasizes killing girlfriend mean really just white girl talking white screw stop just go chicks white real white adolf hitler okay think done overall I give song feels like guys just step genuinely clever like flirt idea making puns work just fundamental misunderstanding wordplay actually effecting listener makes attempts awkward unintentionally funny soon much take second glance furthermore video shows guy getting girl stocking face look confused moves arm hell going video lifts face wearing thing face thing face moves say something seemed like girls nothing mannequins yeah paused starts dancing well got wish wanting see dance video puts head fu anyways I rap critic like opinion missed rappers hide sexual objectification behind artistic pretentiousness embed share urlcopy embed copy

anyway anything provides convenient cover whatever want democracy allows say according will people given rise modern bureaucracies make seem like every aspect lives affected government precisely controlled threats violence yet illusion participation voting keeps us coming back pragmatic creatures disagree existing social order eat less gone along progression racket productivity increased governments grown demand selfgovernment accelerating illusion democracy wont satisfy major historical revolutions made racket difficult even unworkable times global paradigm shift freedom will shed racket society evolved retained primal instincts communal species dependent dependent cooperation maintain standard living enhance chances survival reproduction cooperation superior coercion

since that,she said,NA
calves’-feet,as Michelangelo passed eight months in the mountains of Carrara choosing the most perfect blocks of marble for the monument of Julius II— Françoise expended on these comings and goings so much ardour that Mamma,NA
or victorious,the vague and conflicting reports which we receive,NA
and I realised that I had been doubly right in abandoning my intention. Until now,I had reckoned only that I had not the ‘gift’ for writing; now M. de Norpois took from me the ambition also. I wanted to express to him what had been my dreams; trembling with emotion,NA
not so important as the other,but very brightly,NA
but thought it more delicate to compliment people upon their possessions only by a half-indicated sign of intelligent sympathy; on the other hand,as he was himself immensely rich,NA
silent until then,‘takes up at a given moment,NA
what simple costumes,what intelligence to have chosen Phèdre. No; I have not been disappointed!”,NA
for I did not grasp the wit or folly,the eloquence or pomposity which he found in a statement or a speech,NA
whose command I hastened,naturally,NA
obviously not one of the methods which one could officially recommend,but one which King Theodosius might allow himself to adopt — and that is to break the windows. Which he accordingly did,NA
for whom the supreme law appears to be that of inertia,may have been shaken from their habitual repose. As for Vaugoubert,NA
boyish charm by which King Theo-dosius has won so many hearts. I am assured that,just as he uttered that word ‘affinities,NA
for I am stoutly opposed to all innovations in terminology. Nine times out of ten they are most dangerous.”,NA,NA
women as well as men,and without seeming over-bold,NA
so much at home in the best houses,effusively thanking the Chief Secretary to the Minister of Posts for having come to them,NA
and repeated it on every possible occasion with an air of disappointment which seemed to imply: “After all,it’s not impossible in any way; it would be just my luck.” Meanwhile all the virtue had gone from the optimistic maxim which had hitherto guided Odette through life: “You can do anything with men when they’re in love with you,NA
if they are not to fade away and be altogether lost,to receive sustenance from without. Your most ardent longing is to humiliate the man who has insulted you. But if you never hear of him again,NA
if I tell you of a little episode which is not without point; no more than four years ago,at a small railway station in one of the countries of Central Europe,NA
of undergoing others more drastic still,when so many new and threatening problems are arising on every side,NA
and he actually let it be understood that he was not to be invited without his companion. I trust that I am no more of a prude than most men,and,NA
or rather the aspect of the old greybeard whose form Minerva borrows,to penetrate,NA
feeble as they were when measured against the flood of gratitude that was coursing through me,had seemed to me bound to touch M. de Norpois and to confirm his decision upon an intervention which would have given him so little trouble and me so much joy,NA
the melancholy of which they compare with what they have been trying to express in prose,are so filled with that idea of genius that they add it to their own productions,NA
it was simply because I was afraid of annoying him. And on that day,as an author becomes alarmed when he sees the fruits of his own meditation,NA
perhaps,a cry like the chicken’s. “Just wait till you see,NA
one so solid that nothing could destroy it,so wonderful that I hoped that Gilberte would go out of her way to preserve it in all its beauty,NA
reminded her at every moment that love is an exquisite thing,as of course she already knew,NA
to the movements of the living person whom as a rule,when we are not in love,NA
damp walls at the entrance,where I stood waiting for Françoise,NA
not by any important idea,but by a mouldy smell,NA
I had come running into the dining-room where my parents were already at table,and — having assured myself,NA
had recommended me to take,as well as the caffeine which had been prescribed to help me to breathe,NA
to a toxi-alimentary dyspnoea with renal insufficiency,to chronic bronchitis,NA
the sight of it,unaccompanied by any belief in it,NA
it became an object of my dreams,became,NA
it is best to make no attempt to understand it,since in so far as these are inexorable,NA
and he was sitting with me simply as a visitor because my parents had invited him to stay to dinner,Bloch was allowed to come in. While we were all talking,NA
which seemed to me the very stare of the Swanns themselves,it fell to my lot,NA
if one of them happened to be passing at the moment of my arrival,so far from seeming annoyed would come and shake hands with a smile,NA
was not unlimited,after a certain number of weeks I saw reappear the sheet that bore (like the first letter she had written me) the motto Per vaim rectam,NA
its paralysis was but momentary. The cakes that I took without noticing them,a time would come when I should have to digest them. But that time was still remote. Meanwhile Gilberte was making ‘my’ tea. I went on drinking it indefinitely,NA
since she also had begun to form a salon,she had borrowed Mme. Verdurin’s mannerisms,NA
my influence over their daughter. I reminded myself of that letter,so complete,NA
and used to make room for them in all the stories which,by a habit formed among the ‘little clan,NA
while I’ve been in the library for a minute,the bell has never stopped ringing; upon my word,NA
gad! they’ve had to get it back as best they could.”,NA,NA
as compared with the great majority of groups in society,taste,NA
or the Tromberts.” And so with all the new people whom I told her that I had seen in that somewhat composite and artificial society,to which they had often been brought with great difficulty and from widely different surroundings,NA
with the tidings,a latent germ of envy and of wonder. Mme. Cottard,NA
and the kaleidoscope scattered once again its little scraps of colour. Everything Jewish,even the smart lady herself,NA
merciless in his censure of their most delicate utterances,while they go into ecstasies,NA
who did not go into society,by another,NA
in the appetised tone of an epicure who has thought of,and intends to try the substitution,NA
since,so long as his amorous malady had lasted,NA
at a party for instance,where she was presumably enjoying herself. That was enough to reawaken in him the old anguish,NA
the cold,the wintry sunlight,NA
forgot everything at her dressmaker’s and was never in time for luncheon made Swann anxious for his digestion but flattered his self-esteem,NA,NA
while I had been waiting,upon my imagination,NA
but in a tone from which I could not quite succeed in banishing the note of uneasiness. He explained to me that the place to which Gilberte had gone was the linen-room,offered himself to shew it to me,NA
this sonata had been played over to me two or three times I found that I knew it quite well. And so it is not wrong to speak of hearing a thing for the first time. If one had indeed,as one supposes,NA
which,of course,NA
one of whom had called Mme. Blatin an old cow. They did not interest me in the least. But I reflected that in going to the Jardin d’Acclimatation,and again on our way home,NA
” her father assured me. Young as she was,she appeared far more sensible already than her parents. When Swann boasted of his wife’s grand friends Gilberte would turn away,NA
her ‘chum,’ as the English say.”,NA
unhoped-for moments,the talk to which we have listened are there now to block the passage of our consciousness,NA
to go out afterwards with them and Gilberte,I imprinted with my gaze — while I sat waiting for them there alone — on the carpet,NA
Mme. Swann was invariably a match for her; halting for a moment before the friend whom her husband had recognised and was addressing,she would introduce us,NA
as though that had been a secret language known to our two selves alone. As it happened everyone in the place knew English — I only had not yet learned the language,and was obliged to say so to Mme. Swann in order that she might cease to make,NA
and they went together into the next room. We could hear their raised voices. And yet I could not bring myself to believe that Gilberte,so submissive,NA
and then,failing to find support,NA
if he were secretly pursuing,beneath them,NA
for each of us finds lucidity only in those ideas which are in the same state of confusion as his own. Besides,as all novelty depends upon the elimination,NA
to give to each of them its full value. And yet one did not find in the speech of Bergotte a certain luminosity which in his books,as in those of some other writers,NA
better than any of them,in their symphonies,NA
one must have a motor which,instead of continuing to run along the earth’s surface,NA
requires to be traced. Thus Bergotte,if he owed nothing to any man for his manner of writing,NA
as he ought to have done,so as to be able to publish it with a clear conscience he would repeat,NA
the forms of his own vices and the limits of his virtue,NA,NA
that he had genius,compared to which social position and official rank were as nothing. He had learned that he had genius,NA
some to an excess,others to an insufficiency of tension,NA
the lock of hair ‘frozen into marble,’ yes,NA
that little pamphlet,that little ‘tract’ of yours!” Mme. Swann assured him,NA
and it is very well done,right or wrong,NA
but from another point of view,” (for Swann made a hobby of collecting scraps of ‘real life’) “he is quite remarkable,NA
to carry out some whim of colouring,had posed in a partial disguise,NA
which would let it be thought that a third Gilberte was in the meantime suffering by being the prey of the two others. Whereas Gilberte was alternately one and the other,and at any given moment no more than one of the two,NA
made tender by our apprehension,to which,NA
that Bergotte addressed himself. I had told him everything that I felt with a freedom which had astonished me,and was due to the fact that,NA
that I should have liked an existence in which I was on intimate terms with the Duchesse de Guermantes,and often came across,NA
always the little bottle-imp bobbing up again. He will find that you have a dilated stomach; he has no need to examine you for it,since he has it already in his eye. You can see it there,NA
and perhaps was right in thinking,that this friendliness on Swann’s part was aimed indirectly at my parents. I seemed to remember having heard once at Combray that he had suggested to them that,NA
they seemed to me so unfair,so completely mistaken,NA
and which we can seek from reality alone: an individual charm — deserved to be ranked by me with those other benefactors more recent in origin but of comparable utility (before finding which we used to imagine without any warmth the seductive charms of Mantegna,of Wagner,NA
for want of space had prevented my parents from taking them in at home,and they were stored in a warehouse. But as soon as I discovered them again in the house where these women were putting them to their own uses,NA
that we make our irrevocable decisions. I could scarcely imagine that that strange substance which was housed in Gilberte,and from her permeated her parents and her home,NA
and involved no introspection from without,that kind of pleasure,NA
I had no longer the same hope that they would be realised at once,no longer the courage,NA
who was most completely taken in by this illusion,which misled me as well as my parents,NA
things upon which our whole friendship hung,and these things were never the same. But at least I was happy,NA
no doubt,in earlier days,NA
I was irresistibly drawn towards her in thought,and those alternative orientations,NA
we go at once to find her. When we withdraw from the pan in which our pride lies a small quantity of the will-power which we have weakly allowed to exhaust itself with increasing age,when we add to the pan that holds our suffering a physical pain which we have acquired and have let grow,NA
how are we to imagine the actual state of mind of a woman whom,even when we are conscious that we are of no account to her,NA
I saw clearly how far it was chimerical. I was like a pauper who moistens his dry crust with fewer tears if he assures himself that,at any moment,NA
then looked upon as remote,of a Paris darker than Paris is to-day,NA
consoling them with its real plants which they could tend as they grew for the bareness of the winter soil; and even more than those little houses themselves,those winter-gardens were like the hothouse that the children could see there at the same time,NA
’ for she always used stately language to describe the simplest happenings. “I should never have suspected it,” was Mme. Swann’s comment,NA
she’s simply devoted to you,” said Mme. Swann. “Really,NA
and proves that every ‘go-between’ is either lacking in foresight or else singularly disinterested.) He had conceded only that Odette and Mme. Verdurin might exchange visits once a year,and even this seemed excessive to some of the ‘faithful,NA
whom the ‘Mistress’ called by her Christian name. “Can I drop you anywhere?” Mme. Verdurin asked her,unable to bear the thought that one of the faithful was going to remain behind instead of following her from the room. “Oh,NA
assuring their hostess that “most unfortunately,we had another engagement last week.” So Mme. Bontemps was calculating how many Wednesdays there could still be left before Easter,NA
and has thus pleasantly excited the voluptuous instincts of the lover or mistress; it was the age,too,NA
“made a complete conquest,first shot,NA
but to make us believe that such a thing is probable the desire,the need that we have for it suffices. The soldier is convinced that a certain interval of time,NA
my own. It was to a slow and painful suicide of that part of me which was Gilberte’s lover that I was goading myself with untiring energy,with a clear sense not only of what I was presently doing but of what must result from it in the future; I knew not only that after a certain time I should cease to love Gilberte,NA
do what one may,cannot be broken down from without by him whom they maddeningly exclude; it is when he is no longer concerned with them that suddenly,NA
and which the other will not understand,one speaks for oneself alone. I wrote: “I had thought that it would not be possible. Alas,NA
’ Mme. Swann heaped up and buffeted into position behind my back were sprinkled with Louis XV garlands and not,as of old,NA
or invented,a physiognomy of her own,NA
enjoyed in the slender young woman with pensive eyes and tired features,caught in a pose between rest and motion,NA
to make up,along a whole section of its course,NA
gave to her stay-at-home laziness on those afternoons something alert and energetic. And no doubt the daring simplicity of their cut was singularly appropriate to her figure and to her movements,which her sleeves appeared to be symbolising in colours that varied from day to day: one would have said that there was a sudden determination in the blue velvet,NA
with the result that the news that one is shortly to see her whom one loves would cause a disturbance which would be none too pleasant. What one procrastinates now from day to day is no longer the end of the intolerable anxiety caused by separation,it is the dreaded renewal of emotions which can lead to nothing. How infinitely one prefers to any such interview the docile memory which one can supplement at one’s pleasure with dreams,NA
had since multiplied to an incalculable power. Only,the tendency which everything that exists has to prolong its own existence is sometimes interrupted by sudden impulses to which we give way with all the fewer scruples over letting ourselves go since we know for how many days,NA
told him to go by the Champs-Elysées,at one end of which was the shop of a big dealer in oriental things,NA
if not by a logical effect,at any rate as a fortuitous consequence of that initial success,NA
more subtle,but no less efficacious. It is then,NA
I should have been content to ask for no more than occasional meetings,which now would no longer have contented me and for which I should now have substituted quite different terms. For in this respect love is not like war; after the battle is ended we renew the fight with keener ardour,NA
it is not so with those special memories,those cutting words,NA
when it no longer spells any good fortune to us,we shall ultimately secure is not good fortune,NA
behaved with the utmost treachery towards me and appeared to believe that I had been treacherous to him. Abruptly awakened by the nain which this dream had given me,and finding that it persisted after I was awake,NA
then occupy a place which,however small it may be at first,NA
and settle down at Balbec. But to do that I should have had to leave Paris,to forego those visits thanks to which,NA
at the summits of their tall bare stalks,like the rectilinear trees in pre-Raphaelite paintings,NA
and go for a walk before it. During May,that year,NA
accompanied by the slightly scandalised admiration of a suite which dares not venture any criticism,step out of their boxes during a gala performance and visit the lobby of the theatre,NA

a very beautiful boy,that king Tantalus committed the crime,NA
and Linus,were unable to abstain from dishonoring their gods by fables. But yet these theologues worshipped the gods,NA
not far from Mount Garganus in Apulia,and that these birds fly round about this temple,NA
and,being restored to his proper form in the tenth year,NA
imbued with these wicked arts,were said to be in the habit of giving to such travellers as they chose,NA
or power of the demons; but the phantasm of a man which even in thought or dreams goes through innumerable changes,may,NA
and afterwards could nowhere be found,being destroyed by bad avenging angels,NA
because of his wonderful strength. Now the Latins made Æneas one of their gods,because at his death he was nowhere to be found. The Sabines also placed among the gods their first king,NA
who also reigned forty years,his son Solomon was king of Israel,NA
the first of whom I shall describe in the Virgilian verse:,NA,NA
in that way honoring or excusing her adultery,adding as a proof that a shewolf nursed the infants when exposed. For they think this kind of beast belongs to Mars,NA
not much more than a thousand years had passed when Ninus subdued all Asia with the exception of India. But Rome did not with the same quickness and facility wholly subdue all those nations of the east and west which we see brought under the Roman empire,because,NA
so as to rise from the superficial square to the cube,comes to twenty-seven. But if you join the initial letters of these five Greek words,NA
and with impure mouth will spit out envenomed spittle; but He will with simplicity yield His holy back to stripes. And He will hold His peace when struck with the first,that no one may find out what word,NA
could nowhere be found,the Romans,NA
who must be added to Thales,whom we mentioned above,NA
and they were restored to liberty. Tarquin then reigned as the seventh king of the Romans. On his expulsion,they also began to be free from the rule of their kings. Down to this time the people of Israel had prophets; but,NA
but was called by the same name—also puts at the head of his book these four kings named by Hosea,saying by way of preface that he prophesied in their days.3 Micah also names the same times as those of his prophecy,NA
the one under the term sons of Judah,the other as sons of Israel,NA
he says,“Behold,NA
Bethlehem,of the house of Ephratah,NA
“And those who are saved again shall come up out of Mount Sion,that they may defend Mount Esau,NA
the idols of the false gods,exterminated through the gospel,NA
in wrath Thou wilt be mindful of mercy.” What is this but that He puts Himself for the Jews,of whose nation He was,NA
says,“The breath of our mouth,NA
and they who shall be left of Israel shall fear the name of the Lord.”6 These are the remnant of whom the apostle quotes that which is elsewhere prophesied: “Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea,a remnant shall be saved.”7 These are the remnant of that nation who have believed in Christ.,NA
and His kingdom shall not be destroyed.”8,NA,NA
and their abominations,and all their iniquities. And I will save them out of all their dwelling-places wherein they have sinned,NA
“And the desired of all nations shall come,” is looked for at His last coming. For ere men can desire and and wait for Him,NA
speaking in the Spirit of prophecy to Christ Himself of the remission of sins through His blood,he says,NA
neither will I accept a gift at your hand,” cannot deny that their sacrifice has ceased,NA
another wine,the third women,NA
besides these,we take their predecessors,NA
seeing that in the very history of the kings of Judah and Israel containing their acts,which we believe to belong to the canonical Scripture,NA
which is wont falsely and vainly to glory in the antiquity of her doctrines,is found to have preceded in time the wisdom of our patriarchs in her own wisdom,NA
scattered everywhere through the earth,when they read the most learned writers,NA
whether it was so or not. But what can human misery do,or how or where can it reach forth,NA
in the conspicuous and well-known porch,in gymnasia,NA
but according to God who hath spoken by them. If sacrilege is forbidden there,God hath forbidden it. If it is said,NA
on his death his generals did not peaceably divide that most ample kingdom among them for a possession,but rather dissipated it,NA
who translated these same Scriptures into the Latin speech,not from the Greek,NA
although under a different signification. And this may admonish the reader not to despise the authority of either,but to raise himself above the history,NA
that is,to the Church than to Christ,NA
with impious folly,that He was to be worshipped along with false gods. Then Ptolemy son of Lagus,NA
but generals or principes. Although a king himself may be called a prince,from his principality in governing,NA
is,God with us.”2 He did many miracles that He might commend God in Himself,NA
not by earthly but heavenly fellowship,to the true Israelites,NA
“And I will give peace in this place,”3 He is to be understood who is typified by that typical place; for since by that rebuilt place is typified the Church which was to be built by Christ,NA
when the wicked must be separated from the good,that in the good,NA
He said,“It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power; but ye shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you,NA
and,going without,NA
since they are thought to have the Christian name and sacraments,Scriptures,NA
the ninth by Aurelian,the tenth by Diocletian and Maximian. For as there were ten plagues in Egypt before the people of God could begin to go out,NA
they had not at all questioned Him about the hour,or day,NA
after the completion of that number of years,should at once take end. Oh the hearts of learned men! Oh,NA
the faith had not yet been defined to all,but was defined in the resurrection of Christ (for so the Apostle Paul speaks to the Athenians,NA
and diverse love,until they must be separated by the last judgment,NA

calves’-feet,as Michelangelo passed eight months in the mountains of Carrara choosing the most perfect blocks of marble for the monument of Julius II— Françoise expended on these comings and goings so much ardour that Mamma,NA
or victorious,the vague and conflicting reports which we receive,NA
and I realised that I had been doubly right in abandoning my intention. Until now,I had reckoned only that I had not the ‘gift’ for writing; now M. de Norpois took from me the ambition also. I wanted to express to him what had been my dreams; trembling with emotion,NA
not so important as the other,but very brightly,NA
but thought it more delicate to compliment people upon their possessions only by a half-indicated sign of intelligent sympathy; on the other hand,as he was himself immensely rich,NA
silent until then,‘takes up at a given moment,NA
what simple costumes,what intelligence to have chosen Phèdre. No; I have not been disappointed!”,NA
for I did not grasp the wit or folly,the eloquence or pomposity which he found in a statement or a speech,NA
whose command I hastened,naturally,NA
obviously not one of the methods which one could officially recommend,but one which King Theodosius might allow himself to adopt — and that is to break the windows. Which he accordingly did,NA
for whom the supreme law appears to be that of inertia,may have been shaken from their habitual repose. As for Vaugoubert,NA
boyish charm by which King Theo-dosius has won so many hearts. I am assured that,just as he uttered that word ‘affinities,NA
for I am stoutly opposed to all innovations in terminology. Nine times out of ten they are most dangerous.”,NA,NA
women as well as men,and without seeming over-bold,NA
so much at home in the best houses,effusively thanking the Chief Secretary to the Minister of Posts for having come to them,NA
and repeated it on every possible occasion with an air of disappointment which seemed to imply: “After all,it’s not impossible in any way; it would be just my luck.” Meanwhile all the virtue had gone from the optimistic maxim which had hitherto guided Odette through life: “You can do anything with men when they’re in love with you,NA
if they are not to fade away and be altogether lost,to receive sustenance from without. Your most ardent longing is to humiliate the man who has insulted you. But if you never hear of him again,NA
if I tell you of a little episode which is not without point; no more than four years ago,at a small railway station in one of the countries of Central Europe,NA
of undergoing others more drastic still,when so many new and threatening problems are arising on every side,NA
and he actually let it be understood that he was not to be invited without his companion. I trust that I am no more of a prude than most men,and,NA
or rather the aspect of the old greybeard whose form Minerva borrows,to penetrate,NA
feeble as they were when measured against the flood of gratitude that was coursing through me,had seemed to me bound to touch M. de Norpois and to confirm his decision upon an intervention which would have given him so little trouble and me so much joy,NA
the melancholy of which they compare with what they have been trying to express in prose,are so filled with that idea of genius that they add it to their own productions,NA
it was simply because I was afraid of annoying him. And on that day,as an author becomes alarmed when he sees the fruits of his own meditation,NA
perhaps,a cry like the chicken’s. “Just wait till you see,NA
one so solid that nothing could destroy it,so wonderful that I hoped that Gilberte would go out of her way to preserve it in all its beauty,NA
reminded her at every moment that love is an exquisite thing,as of course she already knew,NA
to the movements of the living person whom as a rule,when we are not in love,NA
damp walls at the entrance,where I stood waiting for Françoise,NA
not by any important idea,but by a mouldy smell,NA
I had come running into the dining-room where my parents were already at table,and — having assured myself,NA
had recommended me to take,as well as the caffeine which had been prescribed to help me to breathe,NA
to a toxi-alimentary dyspnoea with renal insufficiency,to chronic bronchitis,NA
the sight of it,unaccompanied by any belief in it,NA
it became an object of my dreams,became,NA
it is best to make no attempt to understand it,since in so far as these are inexorable,NA
and he was sitting with me simply as a visitor because my parents had invited him to stay to dinner,Bloch was allowed to come in. While we were all talking,NA
which seemed to me the very stare of the Swanns themselves,it fell to my lot,NA
if one of them happened to be passing at the moment of my arrival,so far from seeming annoyed would come and shake hands with a smile,NA
was not unlimited,after a certain number of weeks I saw reappear the sheet that bore (like the first letter she had written me) the motto Per vaim rectam,NA
its paralysis was but momentary. The cakes that I took without noticing them,a time would come when I should have to digest them. But that time was still remote. Meanwhile Gilberte was making ‘my’ tea. I went on drinking it indefinitely,NA
since she also had begun to form a salon,she had borrowed Mme. Verdurin’s mannerisms,NA
my influence over their daughter. I reminded myself of that letter,so complete,NA
and used to make room for them in all the stories which,by a habit formed among the ‘little clan,NA
while I’ve been in the library for a minute,the bell has never stopped ringing; upon my word,NA
gad! they’ve had to get it back as best they could.”,NA,NA
as compared with the great majority of groups in society,taste,NA
or the Tromberts.” And so with all the new people whom I told her that I had seen in that somewhat composite and artificial society,to which they had often been brought with great difficulty and from widely different surroundings,NA
with the tidings,a latent germ of envy and of wonder. Mme. Cottard,NA
and the kaleidoscope scattered once again its little scraps of colour. Everything Jewish,even the smart lady herself,NA
merciless in his censure of their most delicate utterances,while they go into ecstasies,NA
who did not go into society,by another,NA
in the appetised tone of an epicure who has thought of,and intends to try the substitution,NA
since,so long as his amorous malady had lasted,NA
at a party for instance,where she was presumably enjoying herself. That was enough to reawaken in him the old anguish,NA
the cold,the wintry sunlight,NA
forgot everything at her dressmaker’s and was never in time for luncheon made Swann anxious for his digestion but flattered his self-esteem,NA,NA
while I had been waiting,upon my imagination,NA
but in a tone from which I could not quite succeed in banishing the note of uneasiness. He explained to me that the place to which Gilberte had gone was the linen-room,offered himself to shew it to me,NA
this sonata had been played over to me two or three times I found that I knew it quite well. And so it is not wrong to speak of hearing a thing for the first time. If one had indeed,as one supposes,NA
which,of course,NA
one of whom had called Mme. Blatin an old cow. They did not interest me in the least. But I reflected that in going to the Jardin d’Acclimatation,and again on our way home,NA
” her father assured me. Young as she was,she appeared far more sensible already than her parents. When Swann boasted of his wife’s grand friends Gilberte would turn away,NA
her ‘chum,’ as the English say.”,NA
unhoped-for moments,the talk to which we have listened are there now to block the passage of our consciousness,NA
to go out afterwards with them and Gilberte,I imprinted with my gaze — while I sat waiting for them there alone — on the carpet,NA
Mme. Swann was invariably a match for her; halting for a moment before the friend whom her husband had recognised and was addressing,she would introduce us,NA
as though that had been a secret language known to our two selves alone. As it happened everyone in the place knew English — I only had not yet learned the language,and was obliged to say so to Mme. Swann in order that she might cease to make,NA
and they went together into the next room. We could hear their raised voices. And yet I could not bring myself to believe that Gilberte,so submissive,NA
and then,failing to find support,NA
if he were secretly pursuing,beneath them,NA
for each of us finds lucidity only in those ideas which are in the same state of confusion as his own. Besides,as all novelty depends upon the elimination,NA
to give to each of them its full value. And yet one did not find in the speech of Bergotte a certain luminosity which in his books,as in those of some other writers,NA
better than any of them,in their symphonies,NA
one must have a motor which,instead of continuing to run along the earth’s surface,NA
requires to be traced. Thus Bergotte,if he owed nothing to any man for his manner of writing,NA
as he ought to have done,so as to be able to publish it with a clear conscience he would repeat,NA
the forms of his own vices and the limits of his virtue,NA,NA
that he had genius,compared to which social position and official rank were as nothing. He had learned that he had genius,NA
some to an excess,others to an insufficiency of tension,NA
the lock of hair ‘frozen into marble,’ yes,NA
that little pamphlet,that little ‘tract’ of yours!” Mme. Swann assured him,NA
and it is very well done,right or wrong,NA
but from another point of view,” (for Swann made a hobby of collecting scraps of ‘real life’) “he is quite remarkable,NA
to carry out some whim of colouring,had posed in a partial disguise,NA
which would let it be thought that a third Gilberte was in the meantime suffering by being the prey of the two others. Whereas Gilberte was alternately one and the other,and at any given moment no more than one of the two,NA
made tender by our apprehension,to which,NA
that Bergotte addressed himself. I had told him everything that I felt with a freedom which had astonished me,and was due to the fact that,NA
that I should have liked an existence in which I was on intimate terms with the Duchesse de Guermantes,and often came across,NA
always the little bottle-imp bobbing up again. He will find that you have a dilated stomach; he has no need to examine you for it,since he has it already in his eye. You can see it there,NA
and perhaps was right in thinking,that this friendliness on Swann’s part was aimed indirectly at my parents. I seemed to remember having heard once at Combray that he had suggested to them that,NA
they seemed to me so unfair,so completely mistaken,NA
and which we can seek from reality alone: an individual charm — deserved to be ranked by me with those other benefactors more recent in origin but of comparable utility (before finding which we used to imagine without any warmth the seductive charms of Mantegna,of Wagner,NA
for want of space had prevented my parents from taking them in at home,and they were stored in a warehouse. But as soon as I discovered them again in the house where these women were putting them to their own uses,NA
that we make our irrevocable decisions. I could scarcely imagine that that strange substance which was housed in Gilberte,and from her permeated her parents and her home,NA
and involved no introspection from without,that kind of pleasure,NA
I had no longer the same hope that they would be realised at once,no longer the courage,NA
who was most completely taken in by this illusion,which misled me as well as my parents,NA
things upon which our whole friendship hung,and these things were never the same. But at least I was happy,NA
no doubt,in earlier days,NA
I was irresistibly drawn towards her in thought,and those alternative orientations,NA
we go at once to find her. When we withdraw from the pan in which our pride lies a small quantity of the will-power which we have weakly allowed to exhaust itself with increasing age,when we add to the pan that holds our suffering a physical pain which we have acquired and have let grow,NA
how are we to imagine the actual state of mind of a woman whom,even when we are conscious that we are of no account to her,NA
I saw clearly how far it was chimerical. I was like a pauper who moistens his dry crust with fewer tears if he assures himself that,at any moment,NA
then looked upon as remote,of a Paris darker than Paris is to-day,NA
consoling them with its real plants which they could tend as they grew for the bareness of the winter soil; and even more than those little houses themselves,those winter-gardens were like the hothouse that the children could see there at the same time,NA
’ for she always used stately language to describe the simplest happenings. “I should never have suspected it,” was Mme. Swann’s comment,NA
she’s simply devoted to you,” said Mme. Swann. “Really,NA
and proves that every ‘go-between’ is either lacking in foresight or else singularly disinterested.) He had conceded only that Odette and Mme. Verdurin might exchange visits once a year,and even this seemed excessive to some of the ‘faithful,NA
whom the ‘Mistress’ called by her Christian name. “Can I drop you anywhere?” Mme. Verdurin asked her,unable to bear the thought that one of the faithful was going to remain behind instead of following her from the room. “Oh,NA
assuring their hostess that “most unfortunately,we had another engagement last week.” So Mme. Bontemps was calculating how many Wednesdays there could still be left before Easter,NA
and has thus pleasantly excited the voluptuous instincts of the lover or mistress; it was the age,too,NA
“made a complete conquest,first shot,NA
but to make us believe that such a thing is probable the desire,the need that we have for it suffices. The soldier is convinced that a certain interval of time,NA
my own. It was to a slow and painful suicide of that part of me which was Gilberte’s lover that I was goading myself with untiring energy,with a clear sense not only of what I was presently doing but of what must result from it in the future; I knew not only that after a certain time I should cease to love Gilberte,NA
do what one may,cannot be broken down from without by him whom they maddeningly exclude; it is when he is no longer concerned with them that suddenly,NA
and which the other will not understand,one speaks for oneself alone. I wrote: “I had thought that it would not be possible. Alas,NA
’ Mme. Swann heaped up and buffeted into position behind my back were sprinkled with Louis XV garlands and not,as of old,NA
or invented,a physiognomy of her own,NA
enjoyed in the slender young woman with pensive eyes and tired features,caught in a pose between rest and motion,NA
to make up,along a whole section of its course,NA
gave to her stay-at-home laziness on those afternoons something alert and energetic. And no doubt the daring simplicity of their cut was singularly appropriate to her figure and to her movements,which her sleeves appeared to be symbolising in colours that varied from day to day: one would have said that there was a sudden determination in the blue velvet,NA
with the result that the news that one is shortly to see her whom one loves would cause a disturbance which would be none too pleasant. What one procrastinates now from day to day is no longer the end of the intolerable anxiety caused by separation,it is the dreaded renewal of emotions which can lead to nothing. How infinitely one prefers to any such interview the docile memory which one can supplement at one’s pleasure with dreams,NA
had since multiplied to an incalculable power. Only,the tendency which everything that exists has to prolong its own existence is sometimes interrupted by sudden impulses to which we give way with all the fewer scruples over letting ourselves go since we know for how many days,NA
told him to go by the Champs-Elysées,at one end of which was the shop of a big dealer in oriental things,NA
if not by a logical effect,at any rate as a fortuitous consequence of that initial success,NA
more subtle,but no less efficacious. It is then,NA
I should have been content to ask for no more than occasional meetings,which now would no longer have contented me and for which I should now have substituted quite different terms. For in this respect love is not like war; after the battle is ended we renew the fight with keener ardour,NA
it is not so with those special memories,those cutting words,NA
when it no longer spells any good fortune to us,we shall ultimately secure is not good fortune,NA
behaved with the utmost treachery towards me and appeared to believe that I had been treacherous to him. Abruptly awakened by the nain which this dream had given me,and finding that it persisted after I was awake,NA
then occupy a place which,however small it may be at first,NA
and settle down at Balbec. But to do that I should have had to leave Paris,to forego those visits thanks to which,NA
at the summits of their tall bare stalks,like the rectilinear trees in pre-Raphaelite paintings,NA
and go for a walk before it. During May,that year,NA

which might at the same time prove shocking to our ideas,just as her way of listening to our assertions bore witness to her incredulity,NA
almost separated from the rest,in a prominence that was a form of speech,NA
had come towards me,with the sole result that I had been able to see that she had nothing in real life of that amorous facility which one supposed to be stamped upon her in the magic pictures. I had learned that it was not possible to touch her,NA
and,since the cycles through which we are able to make things and people pass in the course of our existence are comparatively few,NA
give successively as setting to the same church the arched walls of all the others — I can think of nothing that can so effectively as a kiss evoke from what we believe to be a thing with one definite aspect,the hundred other things which it may equally well be since each is related to a view of it no less legitimate. In short,NA
well,you see,NA
a sort of conventional and unexpected devotion; and it was farther than to her own childhood,it was to the infancy of the race that she had reverted. Very different from myself who had looked for nothing more than a physical alleviation,NA
I admire her style.” Our mothers were acquainted only in the imagination of Mme. Bontemps,who having heard that I had at one time played with Robert Forestier,NA
we forestall the mistake by a grimace of disgust when anyone refers to them in our hearing. When we read our own name,as borne by them,NA
laying her hands on my forehead (as was her habit when she was afraid of hurting my feelings) and saying: “You really must stop hanging about trying to meet Mme. de Guermantes. All the neighbours are talking about you. Besides,look how ill your grandmother is,NA
was endeavouring to conceal her sufferings from the eyes of the neighbours. Quite half of the human race was in tears. And when I came to know the people who composed it I saw that they were so exasperating that I asked myself whether it might not be the adulterous husband and wife (who were so simply because their lawful happiness had been withheld from them,and shewed themselves charming and faithful to everyone but their respective wife and husband) who were in the right. Presently I ceased to have even the excuse of being useful to Jupien for continuing my morning wanderings. For we learned that the cabinet-maker in our courtyard,NA
make gestures indicative of a complete surrender. She resumed an icy coldness towards me if anyone appeared whom she knew. For a long time now in these morning walks,thinking only of what I had to do,NA
the quarantine of the outsider,hopelessly uncouth,NA
having made up her mind to invite me,she was anxious to do me the honours of the best company at her disposal and to keep away those of her friends whose presence might have dissuaded me from coming again,NA
to some page,already filled and turned,NA
did he make it drop in a series of little jerks broken by pauses for at least ten minutes?” or of a Labori: “Why,whenever he opened his mouth,NA
or at least from her manner,that on studying her face whenever she had occasion to treat with the most exquisite simplification what in so many other people would have been a pretext for reviving stale antipathies and recriminations one had the impression of an intense purity of mind,NA
like his father in the Case of Bergotte,knew the Baron ‘without actually knowing him,NA
it is true that,generally speaking,NA
one follows along the brink of the shivering water those attractive paths by which already a first red leaf is blooming like a last rose,one scans that horizon where,NA
and the swift smile of a child whom one did not suppose to be awake. Then one would like to have with one a loving companion,all the more as one feels oneself to be alone and can imagine oneself to be far away from the world,NA
far more thickly than in the streets of the town,it must after sunset be invading the Bois,NA
to her eyebrows,seemed to hesitate. She had probably other plans; if so she sacrificed them willingly,NA
for a purely voluptuous hour,as I held in my arms a body of which my curiosity had long since computed,NA
alone in a great wood which seemed to be consecrated to her,filled it with the mythological terror,NA
delicious emptiness of which I had learned at Balbec to know and to enjoy when,alone in my room as I was now,NA
voluptuous,whimpering passages which sound over the chant of the pilgrims towards the end of Overture to Tannhäuser. I had,NA
have been directed elsewhere,to Mme. de Stermaria; its application to her who inspired it in me so soon afterwards was not therefore — as I so longed so needed to believe — absolutely necessary and predestined,NA
penetrating,icy rain,NA
or that there could be any kind of significance in the fact of one’s leaving one’s work to go and see a friend and shed tears with him on hearing the false report that the Louvre was burned. I had got so far,at Balbec,NA
who,having to start next day for the country,NA
like that of a Christmas manger,just visibly starred here and there by a wick that burned no brighter than a candle. Between that year — to which I could ascribe no precise date — of my Combray life and the evenings at Rivebelle which had,NA
from which he at once expelled me,indicating to me,NA
and the buzz of talk which restored their activity to deafened ears,NA,NA
to titter with sneering contempt or fling back one’s head with a look of fury,to pretend not to know some elderly man who might have done them a service,NA
and not having enough self-control to stifle a spontaneous cry of stupefaction and rage. “So you like the idea of marriage,do you Bibi?” the Prince de Châtellerault could not help exclaiming,NA
to prevent a marriage or to secure a hold over the friend whose secret he discovered. A fifth (for in these groups of four there are never four only) had joined this Platonic party who was more so than any of the others. But religious scruples restrained him until long after the group had broken up,and he himself was a married man,NA
you can’t find it again.” The wisdom of this aphorism impressed the proprietor,for he had already heard it several times in the course of the evening,NA
if they have not been wrong to abandon the practice of attributing the actions of peoples to the will of kings,ought to substitute for the latter the psychology of the person of no importance,NA
a familiarity from which I alone was excluded,not unlike the spirit that must have prevailed in Noah’s ark. Suddenly I saw the landlord’s body whipped into a series of bows,NA
one realised afterwards that if they had against them hair worn too long,noses and eyes that were too big,NA
but was prevented by the arrival of M. de Foix. Come to see whether his request had been favourably received,we caught sight of him standing beside our table. Robert introduced us,NA
had its meaning,its cause in Saint-Loup’s own personal nature,NA
led him to trample them underfoot,just as he had,NA
included glimpses of historic grandeur of which I became conscious when I went to dine in his house,on the evening following that which I had spent with Saint-Loup,NA
when the Guermantes had ceased to impress me and the tiny drop of their originality was no longer vaporised by my imagination,I was able to distil and analyse it,NA
shews the trace of some historic event unknown,it may be,NA
if not actually forgotten,at the time of Herodotus,NA
before coming gradually down to us,have been enacted by many other Guermantes for numberless other visitors. And as I had said to the Duke that I would like very much to be left alone for a few minutes with the pictures,NA
which has given us the mirage of depth. In view of which is it not logical,not by any artifice of symbolism but by a sincere return to the very root of the impression,NA
they had supposed,must remain for ever a ‘horror’ (Manet’sOlympia,NA
the innumerable reflexions of one thing and another came crowding into this little square panel of beauty which Elstir had cut out of a marvellous afternoon. What delighted one in the dress of a woman who had stopped for a moment in the dance because it was hot and she was out of breath was irresistible also in the same way in the canvas of a motionless sail,in the water of the little harbour,NA
this politeness would be more complete if,by not having dinner announced immediately,NA
so that the smile which she was holding on indefinitely,like the note of a tuning-fork,NA
without my having to stir from Paris,of myself; it was in the algebraical expression of a journey to the city of Correggio a simple equation,NA
by weakening your own position,would diminish the efficacy of your benevolent activities.”,NA
it was important that the great should keep up the exalted traditions of lordly hospitality,by speeches which involved them in nothing. It was also because she sought,NA
M. de Guermantes,with a gallantry that would have done credit to Marshal Saxe,NA
whose own tastes,in later life,NA
entertaining the Duc de Chevreuse at dinner,pretends,NA
habitually dissembled by her mother and intolerable in the sight of her Creator,it was,NA
to think: ‘These people are of another race than ours,and we are,NA
and were in politics so socialistic that one asked oneself where in her mansion could be hiding the familiar spirit whose duty it was to ensure the maintenance of the aristocratic standard of living,and which,NA
whenever she had a message to give to her husband she would say to the butler: “Remind Monsieur le Duc —”,NA,NA
a sort of undefinable convulsion (like that of the Serpent,the genius of the Carthaginian family of Barca) by which my heart had more than once been set throbbing,NA
little enough had it been a question of a passage of arms,seemed immense for a handclasp,NA
for that matter,very rarely occurred — was presented to anyone of the Saint-Loup subsection racked his brains over this abrupt minimum of a greeting,NA
who had scarcely a penny to her name,created more stir with her clothes than all the Courvoisiers put together. The really scandalous things she said gave a sort of advertisement to her style of dressing and doing her hair. She had had the audacity to say to the Russian Grand Duke: “Well,NA
de Montpensier,and she is the eighteenth Oriane de Guermantes in succession,NA
” she imagined herself to have no other reason for consenting to receive them than this charm or cleverness,the familiar spirit not interposing itself at this last moment; more deeply rooted,NA
that Oriane does not care for women’s conversation. She lives surrounded by a court of superior minds — I am not her husband,I am only the first footman. Except for quite a small number,NA
meanwhile,her mind fixed on her game or conversation,NA
they would not be asked to her house. These were a special set of parties,a privilege barred to so many who must have longed for admission. The excluded could,NA
at his own house he entertained no one outside the Faculty,at banquets over which there floated an aroma of carbolic. But in powerful corporations,NA
’ who had never stood for the Chamber,felt,NA
one as a pedant and the other as a clown,despite all the learning of one and the other’s genius,NA
”) might indeed be del void of wit according to Mme. de Guermantes (and in this respect she was right); yet,by dint of hearing and repeating her sayings they had come to imitate more or less her way of expressing herself,NA
but especially about my brother,who is very susceptible,NA
not in reproach but letting her understand all that her clumsiness had made her miss. It was her fault alone if she had not been present at the Creation of the World or at Mme. Carvalho’s last performance. “What do you think of Oriane’s latest? I must say,I do enjoy ‘Teaser Augustus’,NA
who in her own house entertained the flower of the Faubourg Saint-Germain,was quite surprised when she found at Mme. de Courvoisier’s only a notorious old sponger whose husband had been an Imperial Prefect,NA
if from her girlhood everyone had been pitying a model wife,a true saint,NA
Prince des Laumes,sat in the Chamber,NA
that when they open the Deputies themselves are like the commonsense person who will read the published report. Learning that certain workers on strike have sent their delegates to confer with a Minister,they may ask one another innocently: “There now,NA
that is to say the opinion which ought to have been foreseen namely that a duchess ‘was not expected’ to attend the fancy dress bali given by this new Minister: “I do not see that there is any necessity to go to the Greek Minister’s; I do not know him; I am not a Greek; why should I go to these people’s house,I have nothing to do with them?” said the Duchess. “But everybody will be there,NA
sometimes auburn,like the most recent,NA
all the women who had responded to M. de Guermantes’s love,and sometimes even when they had not yet surrendered themselves to him,NA
became a nuisance. The Duke began to take a dislike to her. Then Mme. de Guermantes had an opportunity to bring into prominence the real or imagined defects of a person who annoyed her. Known as a kind woman,Mme. de Guermantes received the telephone messages,NA
casting to right and left of him a glance of amusement,“you heard the Princess tell you that she was a superior woman.” “But isn’t she?” “Superior in chest measurement,NA
to win admiration for the Duchess. “Now,then,NA
” the Duchess interrupted him,“if you mean to inform me that I knew M. de Bornier,NA
perhaps,but in the evenings,NA
upon tragic and other kinds of poetry,a series of remarks which did not reach me distinctly until I caught the following from Mme. d’Arpajon: “Oh,NA
” said the Princesse de Parme to her hostess,impressed by the ardent tone in which the speech had been delivered. “No; she knows absolutely nothing about it,NA
and the usage of nobles who fraternise more readily with their peasants than with the middle classes; peculiarities all of which the regal position of Mme. de Guermantes enabled her to display more easily to bring out with every sail spread. It appears that the same voice existed also in certain of her sisters whom she detested,and who,NA
a thorough relaxation to listen to the talk of Mme. de Guermantes — almost the same feeling,if one was alone with her and she restrained and clarified still further her flow of words,NA
her Pailleronism,her taste for the younger Dumas were reflected and deliberate. As this taste was the opposite of my own,NA
because he no longer loves her; not in the least,it was because he won’t put her sons down for the Jockey. Does Ma’am call that the behaviour of a woman in love? No; I will go farther;” Mme. de Guermantes added with precision,NA
unconscious or deliberate,which accompany one’s name on the label which society writes out and attaches to one. I remember that a friend of the Guermantes who had expressed a keen desire to meet me gave me as the reason that I was a great friend of his cousin,NA
but Robert flung it out without pausing for breath,one could hardly make out that there was Latin in it,NA
“but he thinks he’s obliged to look severe because you are present,Ma’am,NA
yes,if I see him — it is possible that I may meet him,NA
’ as Mme. Swann would have said,without being expected,NA
as they do with Sovereigns,by proxy,NA
where the wife has had the good taste to stop at the golden,the husband the misfortune to come down to the pinchbeck age of history,NA
when the Princess,unfortunately,NA
whose views of wisdom were somewhat superficial,“and the two branches haven’t intermarried since Louis XIV’s time; the connexion would be rather distant.”,NA
by the accumulation of all the women who had successively borne it,but also in the course of my own short life,NA
but they had known,long before they knew all these names,NA
you have only to talk to his servants,and they,NA
very often these ‘cousins’ were not even related at all. Then from the lips of M. de Guermantes,would flow a fresh wave of “But she’s Oriane’s cousin!” words which seemed to have for the Duke the same practical value as certain epithets,NA
empty-handed,of the ambassadors who had been sent to sue on her behalf for the hand of the Prince of Syracuse,NA
who knew the impossibility of my dear M. de Nassau’s writing to the grandfather of his wife (whose fortune,moreover,NA
the name — which I had found colourless and might have supposed to be modern — of Norpois,carving deeply upon it the beauty of an old medal. And in these cases,NA
with which I had never suspected it of having any affinity,left the unalterable position which it had occupied in my brain,NA
the mysterious life of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. But this departure which I was trying at every moment to effect,M. and Mme. de Guermantes carried the spirit of self-sacrifice so far as to postpone,NA
and to speak to me — a veiled allusion to an invitation to dinner — of her desire to ‘arrange something’ after she had ‘fixed a day’ with Mme. de Guermantes. None of these flower ladies left the room before the Princesse de Parme. The presence of that lady — one must never depart before Royalty — was one of the two reasons,neither of which I had guessed,NA
sought an outlet in a sort of fugitive effusion,all the more intense,NA
your Royal Highness can be reassured,” broke in the lady in waiting with a knowing air,NA
whence the gloomy faces of so many men of fashion,and all those nervous conditions which may make them end in suicide. Well,NA
append to their signatures a philosophico-poetical reflexion,he used to warn novices in an appealing tone: “Your name,NA
with the conditions of a life almost unknown today. In the death-chamber of a contemporary corpse Mme. de Guermantes would not have pointed out,but would immediately have perceived,NA
and it was in long monologues with myself,in which I rehearsed everything that I was going to tell him and gave scarcely a thought to what he might have to say to me,NA
and followed the Baron,who,NA
you were waiting in this room. No? Ah,then they must have put you in the blue drawing-room,NA
the bait of this offer,he held out his hand,NA
my dear friends,if I arrived suddenly like that at full speed at Les Ecorces. But on that head I shall no more keep silence for I feel that the frenzy of grief sweeps its reason away. I am associating with the Duchesse de Guermantes,NA
any more difficult than to dine with the Duchess,and my slight knowledge of heraldry had taught me that the title of Prince is not superior to that of Duke. Besides,NA
but which,once they have been digested by the reindeer,NA
to Prince Friedrich-Karl. We are bored at a dinner-table because our imagination is absent,and because it is bearing us company we are interested in a book. But the people in question are the same. We should like to have known Mme. de Pompadour,NA
far more intelligent,they don’t think of nothing,NA
we thought it prudent,each of us independently,NA
with their tall,wide chimneys to which the sun imparts the most vivid pinks,NA
is not ready. There’s no use saying anything before Swann about Marie-Gilbert’s party,” said the Duke. “I don’t know whether he’s been invited. Gilbert likes him immensely,NA
do you think it’s by one of those big masters I’ve mentioned?” “Nnnnno,” said Swann. “But after all,NA
to be a man of iron,like Comely. “No,NA
making with his lips the grimace which implies: ‘The devil!’ Mme. de Guermantes rippled with laughter. “So my clothes please you? I’m delighted. But I must say that they don’t please me much,” she went on with a sulking air. “Good Lord,NA
who was,incidentally,NA
” said the Duchess to a footman. “Please,Oriane,NA

regrets,disappointments,NA
because of the four plastered walls on which it looked out,while far above,NA
which Mme. Swann employed at the time when she too was seeking to form her little clan,and to draw visitors to herself without moving towards them,NA
so she insisted that the Cambremers,perpetually exploring in their barouche,NA
as though appealing to an intermediary without having to address the staff directly. ‘This thing’ was a vase containing three withered roses with which a well-meaning head waiter had seen fit to decorate the table. “Yes . . . ” said Morel in embarrassment. “You don’t like roses?” “My request ought on the contrary to prove that I do like them,since there are no roses here” (Morel appeared surprised) “but as a matter of fact I do not care much for them. I am rather sensitive to names; and whenever a rose is at all beautiful,NA
“there are still people who did hear him,who can give you an idea. However,NA
exhausted by this initial effort,he gives way,NA
until it stirred the branches of the trees that bury Saint-Jean de la Haise in their foliage,caressing the face of my mistress,NA
by those angels so different from any that he knew. Then she collected her things. Leaning upon one another we walked back up the sunken path,leaving the little church,NA
albeit he was more learned,more intelligent and a better man all round than most people,NA
and indeed was himself content with relatively small wages. But the money that another person received aroused in him an irrepressible curiosity and made his mouth water. During these brief moments,he wore the attentive,NA
of talking and expectorating all the time. “No,it doesn’t matter,NA
sponge,chamois-leather. But he always managed to borrow what he required from a neighbour; only he was late in bringing round the carriage,NA
might have gone to his rescue. During our walk,dropping his voice so that the elder Howsler should not overhear: “What a good fellow he is,NA
which as a matter of fact did make him in certain respects less limited,more of an artist,NA
a few weeks later,the transposition was no less agreeable when,NA
’ a journey whose charm appeared to me all the more thrilling in that it was not an object in itself,and no one made any attempt to find pleasure in it — that being reserved for the party for which we were bound,NA
faithful) from casting at the labourers,soldiers,NA
but to one which has been dead for so long that it no longer claims any devotees whose feelings one need be afraid of hurting.) “We,unfortunately,NA
insisted,said not another word,NA
had not the lodestone of Dreyfusism been so powerful as to carry him in one stride up the steep ascent to la Raspelière,unfortunately upon a day when the Mistress was not at home. Mme. Verdurin as it happened was not certain that he and M. de Charlus moved in the same world. The Baron had indeed said that the Duc de Guermantes was his brother,NA
as it happened,entirely unaware that Mme. de Villeparisis knew quite well who my companion was but did not wish to speak to her. At the next station,NA
for his own part,was exclusively and passionately a lover of women) shewed him,NA
” Brichot interrupted. “But,at the risk of distressing the hearts that are smitten with the Balzacian fever,NA
as though they imagine that by styling a great writer ‘Monsieur’ they are doing him an honour,perhaps keeping him at his proper distance,NA
in a significant tone,looking at Albertine,NA
and for the calamity which was perhaps in store for him and did not in any case cease to alarm him,he had the consolation of finding in his own anxiety what Swann and also Saint-Loup would have called something ‘quite Balzacian.’ This identification of himself with the Princesse de Cadignan had been made easy for M. de Charlus by virtue of the mental transposition which was becoming habitual with him and of which he had already furnished several examples. It was enough in itself,NA
after Charlie (Morel) had left us,M. de Charlus would sing his praises without ceasing,NA
that in spite of all his attempts to meet adversity with a brave face,I saw the tears trickling down and melting the paint beneath his eyes,NA
M. de Charlus had already written to two of his friends (one was Cottard) asking them to be his seconds. And,if the violinist had not appeared,NA
which in itself delighted him and which he would not forego without regret. And in saying this he was quite sincere,for he had always enjoyed taking the field when it was a question of crossing swords or exchanging shots with an adversary. Cottard arrived at length,NA
the Baron did not see or pretended not to see the violinist’s wry grimace,for,NA
knowing very well that it was the contrary that would happen,he could not help dwelling upon all the drawbacks that would be revived with this inevitable tie. But,NA
as the train came to a standstill at Maineville,he saw the Palace staring him in the face,NA
in order to give a lesson,etc.,NA
ordering the doors to be alternately opened and shut,like a policeman regulating the flow of traffic: “Take this gentleman to twenty-eight,NA
turning his head every moment,trembling with fear of being followed and spied upon by M. de Charlus,NA
and a pair of charming blue eyes,he generally spoke in a faint murmur,NA
as the waiter was retiring with this guidance,Aimé,NA
round the particularly succulent board of the Union Club,the Society of Bibliophiles. He was extremely modest,NA
regarding them however solely from the point of view of the pleasant evening that they might help to spend,and so completely ignoring the aesthetic point of view as never to suspect that they might indeed constitute a ‘novelty’ occasionally in the history of art. So it was that,NA
came into conflict in this epistolary style,the second making Mme. de Cambremer redeem the monotony of her multiple adjectives by employing them in a descending scale,NA
we no longer had any idea where we were; the roads were not lighted; we could tell by the louder sound of the wheels that we were passing through a village,we thought we had arrived,NA
without attracting attention,to keep Albertine a prisoner under my own watch and ward,NA
as it happened) that was set before us,poppies,NA
I began to wonder whether I had not been the dupe of an acoustic mirage when I thought I heard M. de Charlus utter those words. “He lives at Balbec?” intoned the Baron,with an air so far from questioning that it is a nuisance that the written language does not possess a sign other than the mark of interrogation with which to end these speeches which are apparently so little interrogative. It is true that such a sign would scarcely serve for M. de Charlus. “No,NA
