## About

Here we attempt to analyze Spotify user behavior by Explorial Data Analysis, statistic inference and Machine Learning.

The data set that was used in this project is Kaggle's [Spotify Song Attributes](https://www.kaggle.com/geomack/spotifyclassification/home) dataset. It was sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/dataset-of-songs-in-spotify). Each row in the data set contains a number of features of songs from 2017 and a binary variable `target` that represents whether the user liked the song (encoded as 1) or not (encoded as 0). See the documentation of all the features [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/).

## Report

The final report can be found [here](https://macychan.github.io/spotify-user-behaviour-predictor/).
