## Spotify User Behaviour Predictor

-   Author: Macy Chan

Spotify user behaviour analysis and prediction model

This project will be used for a self-built Spotify playlist recommendation application - Music and Mood.  
[Click here](https://macy-chan.com/MusicAndMood.html) to learn more about the details of the application.

## About

Here we attempt to analyze Spotify user behavior by explanatory data analysis (EDA), statistic inference and machine learning.

The data set that was used in this project is Kaggle's [Spotify Song Attributes](https://www.kaggle.com/geomack/spotifyclassification/home) dataset. It was sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/dataset-of-songs-in-spotify). Each row in the data set contains a number of features of songs from 2017 and a binary variable `target` that represents whether the user liked the song (encoded as 1) or not (encoded as 0). See the documentation of all the features [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/).

## Upcoming updates
- Edit Conclusion
